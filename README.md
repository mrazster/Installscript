I'm a n00b, just playing around and trying to create my own installscript for xfce4/xubuntu desktop.
The scripts is originally from Joe Collins (https://www.ezeelinux.com/) but has been modified by me.
It´ s intended for personal use and needs, and may wary depending on distro, DE or packages I need to install.

Install/usage:
It´ s meant to be used with "ubuntu minimal iso".
Boot iso and do a "Commandline install".
Then either download the script with wget, make it executable and run it.
Or download it before hand, make it executable, put it on a usb device and run it from there. 

I would gladly take any advice and constrictive feedback.
